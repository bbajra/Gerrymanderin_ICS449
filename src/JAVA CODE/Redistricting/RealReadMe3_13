What we really wanna do
Output is what election results would look like if they were grouped differently*********

so group the precints adjacent to each other so if there are 4120 precints 
divided by cong district(There are 8 congressional district)
4120/8 = 515 precints in each district. so now based on these precints who would win which district?



Real Requirments and how to do it?


if lat and long overlap they are adjacent
Get population data into the precints 
Take the total and divide by # of what we want
Gather together adjacent precints into districts

The one with the fewer adjacent precints link with the precints with more adjacent pairs

generate random precints to start at to get different maps

Step 1. Create a Project that adds the Democrat votes and Republican votes
& total votes to the geojson
Step 2. Find the total Population of everything and save it
Step 3. Turn all the data into precint objects
Precint object has fields
Long Lat
Long Lat String
population
Group #
Array Holding all of the pairs it matches to
Step 4. Right a greedy algorithim that groups so it look at all the
precints that its connected to and then does a count of the precint
to see how many they connect to and then groups the one that has the least amount

update as of 3/18 just need to get Long and Lat into the object

LongLat is now work, all precints are holding latitude and longitude
Whats next?

Modify the GeoJson to add a property called groups: this is where the greedy algoirthim
puts the output. It will group them together and

Write adjacent groups to geoJson? the data is all the same but it would be hard

if we keep grouping the least it will soon run out and it will have to randomly choose,
